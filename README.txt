Test Cost is used as a calculator to test the values assigned to each price of
each product class. If the Test Cost field has a value, no database calls will
be performed. You will receive a list of calculations based on the values
entered.

Cost is a straight calculation of current cost * cost multiplier
 eg. New Cost = Old Cost * Cost Multiplier

Sell Price and Product List Price are calculated differently.
